# Data-Analysis-of-Heterogeneous-Data-Using-LLM
# Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and LLM-Based Correlation Analysis

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focused on **structural equation modeling (SEM) and correlation analysis using LLM tools**. The aim is to explore direct/indirect relationships and latent variables in the dataset, using **SEMOPY, LangChain, and machine learning**.

## üìå **Project Overview**
The two notebooks serve different but related purposes:
1. **Research_LLM.ipynb** - Implements **LangChain tools** to extract correlations from structured data.
2. **SEMOPY.ipynb** - Utilizes **SEMOPY** for Structural Equation Modeling to analyze relationships between variables.
